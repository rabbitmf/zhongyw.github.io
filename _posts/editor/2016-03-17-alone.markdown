You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```js
// 由于 Node 原生支持模块的作用域，并不需要额外的 wrapper
// "as though the module was wrapped in a function"

var a = require('./a')  // 加载模块（同步加载）
a.doSomething()         // 等上一句执行完才会执行

exports.b = function(){ // 暴露 b 函数接口
  // do something
}
```
